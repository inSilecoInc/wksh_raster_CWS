## Why use `r rp()` for rasters? (~20min)


???

If after the workshop what follows makes sense and you feel it is kind of true, it would a success.

# Raster files 

> Raster files are grids of equally sized (most often) cells (or pixels).

--

> Every cell has one or several values (or missing values).

--

> Cells are georeferenced: coordinates + CRS 

--

> Commonly used to represent continuous phenomena (e.g. temperature, elevation) and images (airborne or satellite imagery).

# Raster files 

- Examples of raster file formats: 

  - **GeoTIFF** (see https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff)
  - **NetCDF** (see https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/)
  - **KML** (also supports vector objects, see https://www.ogc.org/standards/kml/)
  - **GeoPackage** (also supports vector objects, see https://www.ogc.org/standards/geopackage)

# Coding vs clicking

### 1. Programming/coding allows to automate what is frequently done!

--

### 2. Allow to make analyses/reports reproducible 

--

  - create data pipeline 
  - for colleagues and future you

--

### 3. Increase efficiency (spend more time thinking)


--

### 4. Feeling empowered

One is not better than the other
do more, oik but do it in a better way

# Why `r rp()`?

<br>

### 1. Freeware + Open source

--

### 2. **Package ecosystem** is rich and under active development  

--

### 3. Many packages connect `r rp()` to other software/language

--

### 4. Community is wide, quite involved, responsive

--

### 5. You are most likely already using it! You are not starting from scratch

--

### **`r rfa("arrow-right")` Very little cannot be done with `r rp()`**


???

Very few people look at the R source code but many people are now involved in package dev via GH or GL.

R Python Julia, whatever, language itself matters less that these
If you have time to learn a bit it might sometime makes sense, notably to work with other colleagues.

You don't start from scratch

# Raster packages

### [`raster`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=raster) .font90[03/2010 (1.0.0) &nbsp; // &nbsp; 11/2020 (3.3-7)]
  
<br>

--
  
### [`terra`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=terra) .font90[03/2019 (0.5-2) &nbsp; // &nbsp; 11/2020 (0.9-11)]
  
> terra is an R package that replaces raster. It has a very similar interface, but it is simpler and much faster. 

<br>
--
  
### [`stars`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stars) .font90[07/2018  (0.1-1) &nbsp; // &nbsp; 07/2020 (0.4-3)]
  
> Reading, manipulating, writing and plotting spatiotemporal arrays (raster and vector data cubes) in 'R'. 

Depends on [`sf`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sf).
Note that `stars` and `sf` are [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) friendly.

# Package [`raster`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=raster)


### - Well documented 
  
  - see https://rspatial.org/raster/
  - many blog posts and tutorials (e.g. https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/01-raster-structure/)

<!-- length(devtools::revdep("raster", dependencies = c("Depends", "
   Imports"))) -->

--

### - 383 packages depend on or import `raster` 

--

### - Depends on `sp` but also works with `sf`.

# Package [`stars`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stars): SpatioTemporal ARrayS

### - Well documented too

.center[![:scale 92%](img/pkgdown_stars.png)]

--

### - 9 packages depend on [`stars`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stars)

### - So far, less material available online.
