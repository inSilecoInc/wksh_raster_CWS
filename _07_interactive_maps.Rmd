## Why use `r rp()` for interactive data visualization? (`r ck()`~10min)

---

# Interactive visualization

## Interactive data visualization

> Interactive data visualization refers to the use of modern data analysis software that enables users to directly manipulate and explore graphical representations of data.

--

## Why use interactive visualization?

  - Identify trends
  - Observe relationships in data
  - Data storytelling
  - Simplify complex data
  - Share and explore data
  - Get more out of static visualizations!

# Interactive visualization

## Javascript

> [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.

--

> JavaScript is the modern interactive web

--

- Close to 1.5 million libraries

--

- Requires in depth knowledge of web-based programming, and, if you are a `r rp()` user, learning another programming language

---

# Why `r rp()`?

<br>

1. `r rp()` packages are actively developped for interactive visualization. See the [htmlwidgets for R](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/) web page for examples

--

2. No need to learn a new language

--

3. Efficiently explore outputs from `r rp()` analyses

--

4. Share interactive outputs of `r rp()` analyses with collaborators in a variety of formats

--

5. For people still using [ArcGIS](www.arcgis.com) or [QGIS](www.qgis.org) solely for visual data exploration: interactive mapping in `r rp()` can now - *partly* - address this

---

# Why `r rp()`?

## HTML widgets

In `r rp()`, HTML widgets are one of two things:

1. The [`htmlwidgets`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=htmlwidgets) package provides a framework for creating R bindings to JavaScript visualization libraries that can be rendered in a variety of formats (*e.g.* RStudio, R Markdown documents, Shiny applications, or standalone web pages).

--

2. A collection of R packages that allow a user to build interactive visualization (*i.e.* tables, charts, maps, networks, etc) through specific JavaScript libraries

## `r rp()` packages for interactive mapping

### **Interactive visualization in general**

.pull-left[
- [`plotly`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=plotly) - uses [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/)
- [`highcharter`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=highcharter) - uses [Highcharts.js](https://jkunst.com/highcharter/)
]

--

.pull-right[
*Work well with vectorized spatial objects (`sf` and `sp`) in particular. Not so much with rasters yet.*
]

--

### **Interactive mapping in particular**

.pull-left[
- [`leaflet`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=leaflet) `r rfa("check")` - uses [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)
]

--

.pull-right[
*Works well with vectors (`sf` and `sp`) and rasters (`raster` and `stars`)*
]

--

### **`r rp()` packages expanding `leaflet` capabilities**

  - [`leafem`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mapview) `r rfa("check")`
  - [`mapview`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mapview) `r rfa("check")`
  - [`tmap`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tmap) `r rfa("check")`
